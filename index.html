    <p>Hi and welcome. My name is Scott Johnson, and I'm currently working 
        as a Sr Operations Controller at DSM Dyneema where I do Finance things
         (MBA, East Carolina University) mixed with Engineer things 
         (BS Industrial Engineering, West Virginia University).  I don't know 
         what I want to be when I grow up, so I'm also coding things via a 
         coding bootcamp through the University of North Carolina.</p>
    <p>West Virginia native (it's not western Virginia, go Mountaineers!), but 
        North Carolina resident for the past 17 years (I don't have to shovel
        snow here, it's awesome).  I love (attempting to play) basketball, all
        things computers, moleskine notbooks, 0.38 point ink pens, and our 25lb
        maine coon cat named Max.  **I changed something here.**
