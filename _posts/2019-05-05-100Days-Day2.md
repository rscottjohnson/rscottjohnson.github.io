Worked up through **[Comparison with the Strict Equality Operator](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/comparison-with-the-strict-equality-operator)** on Free Code Camp's *Introducation to JavaScript* curriculum yesterday, which is good progress especially considering I was down for most of the day not feeling that great.  I'm about a day behind in my tweeting for #100DaysOfCode, but I just add a tweet whenever I think about it.

Today, I downloaded **[Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/desktop/)** and began working up some draft logos for a project I'm working on.  Even though I'm learning my way through, I can already tell it's a great program, and I hope to work through some more tutorials soon.

Ended the programming day updating the **[TobRadio](www.tobradio.com)** website, simplifying it to one page, and adding the Facebook link.
